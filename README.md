The results show that, in general terms, the number of trips and drivers in urbanized cities is higher, as might be expected, while the average cost per trip is higher in rural areas. Suburban zones lie in the middle of the other two types.

This analysis does not consider the costs associated with trips, so it is not possible to determine the profitability by type of city, however, rural trips have a higher average fare , which could represent an incentive to make trips in rural areas.
At the same time, this would represent a decrease in the offer of urban trips that would be reflected in the increase in urban fares.
